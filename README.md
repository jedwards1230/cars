# Miles' Driving School

The project began with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI) tutorial. I wanted to take it further with different training algorithms and a UI.

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I've been distracted with other projects and haven't had a chance to clean this up and make it properly functional. The core is there, I really just need to focus on making training algos work, then it should be simple from there. I need to spend more time researching and properly planning a system rather than just jumping into it (which is what I did and why this is a mess now).

## Network

Check out the [Network](/src/network/) section for detailed information about the machine learning library I've built for this project.

## Project Goals

* Learn machine learning fundamentals
* Learn Javascript/Typescript
* Learn React

<!-- ## Modes of Training

Note: These are likely to change. These were the original thoughts and goals. I will be reworking these in the [Network](/src/network/) Section

* Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT algorithm) (WIP)
  * Randomly generate a population of cars
  * Evaluate each car
  * Select the best car
  * Repeat with mutations of best car
* Live imitation training
  * Control the car with keyboard
  * Backpropagate with control input against network output predictions
* Deep Reinforcement (TODO)
  * Many training loops with algorithms that generate "correct" output for training -->

## Todo

* See [Network](/src/network/) section
* Web workers for training?
* Form validation
  * Ensure network inputs/outputs are anchored to sensor inputs/action counts output
  * Establish better defaults
  * Tooltips or help would be cool
* Save/load specific networks
  * View of all saved models. editable?
